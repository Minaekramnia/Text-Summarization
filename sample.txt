Now that you have a working development and deployment environment, you can start learning about the most popular language for Ethereum smart contracts, Solidity. The instructions for this lab are found in Ethereum For Dummies, chapter 7. In this lab you’ll set up and configure a Truffle project and explore the Solidity language through smart contracts. You’ll also learn how to compile smart contracts and deploy them to a local Ethereum blockchain. And finally, you’ll learn how to interact with smart contract functions. When you finish this lab, you’ll have two simple smart contracts you have written and deployed to your local Ethereum blockchain and be familiar with how to compile and deploy Ethereum blockchain code.
